## Java Array Operations Assignment

Welcome to the Java Array Operations Assignment! This assignment focuses on practicing array manipulations in Java. You will be working on various tasks involving arrays, such as initializing arrays, finding maximum values, and sorting. Each exercise is guided by TODO comments in the code.

### Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `src/main/java/com/example` directory where you will find the `ArrayOperations.java` class file.
3. Open the `ArrayOperations.java` file and complete the exercises according to the instructions in the TODO comments.
4. After completing the exercises, you can run the tests to check your solutions.

### Exercises to Complete

In the `ArrayOperations.java` file, you will find the following exercises:

1. **Initialize and Print an Array**
   - Initialize an array of integers and print its contents.

2. **Find the Maximum Value in an Array**
   - Implement logic to find the maximum value in an integer array.

3. **Check for a Specific Value**
   - Implement logic to check if the array contains a specific integer value.

4. **Calculate the Average of Array Elements**
   - Implement logic to calculate the average of the elements in an integer array.

5. **Reverse an Array**
   - Implement logic to reverse the order of elements in an integer array.

6. **Sort an Array**
   - Implement a sorting algorithm to sort the elements of an integer array.

### Running Tests

After completing the exercises, you can test your solutions by running tests located in the `src/test/java/com/example` directory.

To run the tests, use the command:

```
./gradlew test
```

### Submission

Once you have completed the assignment and all the tests pass, push your solutions to your GitHub repository.

Remember, arrays are a fundamental aspect of Java programming. Understanding how to manipulate arrays efficiently is crucial for many applications. Take this opportunity to solidify your understanding and skills in working with arrays.

Best of luck!
